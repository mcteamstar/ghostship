# File Transfer Security Specification

## Purpose

Security requirements for the file transfer subsystem (supply/evac MCP tools and their
HTTP handlers). The subsystem issues and verifies HMAC-signed presigned URLs for uploading
files into and extracting files from crew workspaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Full-length HMAC
The HMAC-SHA256 digest used in presigned URLs MUST use the full 64-character hexdigest.
Truncation to any shorter length is not permitted.

#### Scenario: Presigned URL carries full-length signature
- **WHEN** the transport generates a presigned download or upload URL
- **THEN** the `sig` query parameter is exactly 64 hexadecimal characters

#### Scenario: Truncated signature is rejected
- **WHEN** a request arrives with a `sig` value shorter than 64 characters
- **THEN** the transport returns 403 Forbidden

### Requirement: Operation-typed tokens
Download tokens and upload tokens MUST be cryptographically non-interchangeable.
The HMAC payload MUST include the operation type (`get` or `put`) as a prefix.
A token issued for download MUST be rejected when presented for upload, and vice versa.

#### Scenario: Download token rejected on upload endpoint
- **WHEN** a caller presents a valid evac (download) presigned URL to the supply (upload) endpoint
- **THEN** the transport returns 403 Forbidden

#### Scenario: Upload token rejected on download endpoint
- **WHEN** a caller presents a valid supply (upload) presigned URL to the evac (download) endpoint
- **THEN** the transport returns 403 Forbidden

#### Scenario: Correct token accepted on correct endpoint
- **WHEN** a caller presents a valid token to the endpoint it was issued for
- **THEN** the request is accepted and processed

### Requirement: Path canonicalisation
All user-supplied paths MUST be resolved with `Path.resolve()` relative to the crew workspace
root before use. Any path that resolves outside the workspace root MUST be rejected with a 400
error. Checking for `..` components alone is not sufficient.

#### Scenario: Path traversal via dot-dot is rejected
- **WHEN** a caller supplies a path such as `../../etc/passwd`
- **THEN** the transport returns a 400 error and does not access the file

#### Scenario: Path traversal without dot-dot is rejected
- **WHEN** a caller supplies a path such as `repo/./../../etc/shadow` that resolves outside the workspace
- **THEN** the transport returns a 400 error

#### Scenario: Valid workspace path is accepted
- **WHEN** a caller supplies a path such as `repo/src/main.py` that resolves inside the workspace
- **THEN** the request proceeds normally

### Requirement: `ref` validation
The `ref` parameter in evac requests MUST be validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]+$` before
being passed to any git subprocess. Values beginning with `-` MUST be rejected. git invocations
MUST pass `--` before any user-supplied ref as an additional defence-in-depth measure.

#### Scenario: ref beginning with dash is rejected
- **WHEN** a caller supplies `ref` starting with `-` (e.g. `--output=/tmp/pwned`)
- **THEN** the transport returns a validation error without executing any git command

#### Scenario: ref with special characters is rejected
- **WHEN** a caller supplies `ref` containing characters outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]`
- **THEN** the transport returns a validation error

#### Scenario: Valid ref is accepted
- **WHEN** a caller supplies a ref such as `main`, `release/0.2.0`, or a commit hash
- **THEN** the ref is passed to the git subprocess with `--` as an option terminator

### Requirement: Token expiry
Presigned URLs MUST include a server-side expiry timestamp. Expired tokens MUST be rejected
regardless of HMAC validity.

#### Scenario: Expired token is rejected
- **WHEN** a caller presents a presigned URL whose `expires` timestamp is in the past
- **THEN** the transport returns 403 Forbidden even if the HMAC is valid

#### Scenario: Non-expired token is accepted
- **WHEN** a caller presents a presigned URL whose `expires` timestamp is in the future
- **AND** the HMAC is valid
- **THEN** the request is accepted
